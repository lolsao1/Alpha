## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependancies with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
(replace 'python' with whatever other command you use to run python e.g. python3.6)
3. Run `main.py` for the first time
4. Edit the generated config.json file with your settings
5. Then you can run `main.py` normally

(Note: the 'servers' key in the config.json file is not meant to be touched, the bot will put info in there. Once I move Alpha to using a database, this shouldn become less confusing.)

## Cogs

- [Here is a guide to writing your own cogs](https://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs/red_guide_make_cog/)
- Any cogs can be put into the cogs folder and will be loaded when you run the bot.
- The bot should work with most cogs, but just open an issue and I'll be happy to help.
- To load a cog without restarting the bot, run this bot command:

  `!reload cogs.name` where '!' is your bot's prefix and 'name' is the name of the cog file without the extension
